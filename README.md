# the-stock-trader

Simple application created using Vue.js, while learning to better use components, routers, Vuex etc.  

The app is very simple with only few components, but simulates buying stocks, selling them, stock changes every time u press 'End Day' button, etc. Form validations are also included. 

Will try to improve once I get more used to using Vue.js but for now it does the trick.

Was using EventBus and different 'hacks' to send data between child components, but Vuex shorts it quite a lot, will use more in the future.
